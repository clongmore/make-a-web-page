<div>
<h2>LESSON 1:  The Basics of the Web and HTML</H2>
<div>
<p>
<b>INTERNET</b>
<div>
<p>
The Internet is a structure made up of millions of computers whose users can communicate with each other and share information.  
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>
<p>
<b>WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW)</b>
<div>
The WWW  gives Internet users easy access to information on the Internet.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>
<p>
<b>HTML</b>
<div>
HTML is Hypertext Markup Language and it is the main, or most common, type of document on the web.  There are other types such as text, images, videos, and music.  HTML was designed to describe the contents of a web page in a very general way.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>
<p>
<b>HTTP</b>
<div>
HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol that sends requests to a server.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<b>Computers are stupid</b> because they can only do what programmers tell them to do.  
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<B>CODING</B>
<div>
Coding is programmers writing in a language that the computer can read.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<b>Let's take a look at some of the basic HTML vocabulary.</b>
</div>
</p>
<p>
<B>TAG:</B>  Turns on a feature which is indicated by an <b>opening tag (<  >),</b> and turns off a feature indicated by a <B>closing tag (< />).</B>
<br><br>
<b>ELEMENT:</b>  Everything within a set of <B>opening and closing tags.</B>
<br><br>
<B>INLINE ELEMENTS:</B>  Tags that do not require a closing tag.
<br><br>
<B>BLOCK ELEMENTS:</B>  Tags that require a closing tag.  Block Elements are similar to an invisible box being placed around the text.
<br><br>
<B>ATTRIBUTE:</B>  A property of an HTML element.
<br><br>
<b>&lt;B&gt;</b>  There is a tag to do <B>BOLD</B> text.
<br><br>
<b>&lt;EM&gt;</b>  There is a tag to do <B><EM>emphasis</B></EM> such as italics.
<br><br>
<b>&lt;BR&gt;</b>  There are tags to do line breaks.
<br><br>
<b>&lt;P&gt;</b>  There are also tags to do paragraphs.
<BR></BR>
There are many others which I look forward to learning in this class.  There are tags to do almost everything.  After all, <B>computers are stupid</B> and will only do what we tell them to do, so we have to talk to them in a language they can understand--<B>HTML</B>

<h2>LESSON 2:  Creating Structured Documents with HTML</H2>
<div>
<P>
The structure of a web page can be determined by looking at its coding or markup language (usually HTML or CSS).  
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>
<p>
<b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b>
<div>
HTML is a programming language that controls the <b>structure</b> of a web page (how it is set up).
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>
<p>
<b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</b>
<div>
CSS is a programming language that controls the <b>style</b> of a page (how it looks).
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>
<B>DOM (Document Object Model)</b>
<div>
<p>
DOM is the tree-like structure of a page. You can relate the tree-like structure to a family tree.  The <b>tree trunk is the main page</b>.  The <b>limbs are pages connected to the trunk</b>.  The <b> branches are pages that are connected to the limbs.</b>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>
<B>DIV Tag &lt;div&gt;</b>
<div>
<p>
The &lt;div&gt; tag defines boxes.  Give each &lt;div&gt; tag a class element to better define the tag.
